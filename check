Is it possible for us to have someothing other than .orig at the beginning of a file
Do we have to check for .end of our assembly file
Shift values are always positive (never negative) if they aren't - error code 3. Same for Trap
Make sure labels arent present more than once in the symbol table during pass 1, if it is error code 4. 
label that starts with the letter ‘x’ or a number) is another example of error code 4.
isalnum()
First pass look for .orig, .end, and labels, and exit based on that.


To determine between invalid opcode and label, we need to look at the arguments that come later, if there is a register or something,
then there is clearly a problem.

cant find a label on .end or .orig

registers
immediates
immediate - signed PCoffset9
immediate - signed PCoffset11
immediate - unsigned amount4
